# xv6-improvements

This project makes some improvements on the already existing xv6 public repositry at https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public.

This adds a new syscall and some new schedulers in the operating system. Details of additions made are in the Requirements.pdf file.

There is an attatched report and images to denote performance improvements.
